# About my project
For the python mini project, I decided to code a piece of code that would allow me to take data of COVID-19 positive cases in New York and represent this data with a graph, generated by the computer.
# About my code
The first part of my code is to import anything we might need from outside sources/libraries.
The second part of my code tells the computer from where I am getting the data I want to use for this project from.
The third part of my code allows you to see the data when you run it.
The last and fourth part of my code allows you to visualize the data in a graph.
